A dusty, aged book catches your eye, so you take it from the shelf.

In the dim light of the shop, the title flashes with a green glow: THEE STOREYS OF A MARINER. Your fingertips brush over the pages as you [[try to open the book|Transported]].

You stare into the page, blinking several times before realizing you are no longer in the store - you are in the book!

You [[look up|Albatross Appears]].</tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="6" name="Albatross Appears" tags="" position="540,973.5" size="100,100">You seen an Albatross fly around the ship, a soft white figure cutting through the angry, grey clouds.

&lt;&lt;elseif $isCapt is 0&gt;&gt;As you watch the Albatross circle the ship, you hear a thunderous bang! The bird's lifeless body slams into the deck with a heavy thud. You and the other crew members look at the Captain, who is holstering a gun.
&lt;&lt;endif&gt;&gt;
Immediately, the clouds and fog and general darkness begin to clear up. The sun's rays warm you once again and the returns to a gentle state. You feel:

You squint into the sparkling water, hearing cries of fear as the ocean begins to thicken and rotting creatures, shiny with ancient slime, emerge from its depths, slithering across the congealed surface. As the sun sets, the ocean appears to burn with unholy green flames.

You fear the killing of the Albatross doomed the ship...

&lt;&lt;if $captGuilty is 1&gt;&gt;In your guilt, you begin to [[pray over the carcass|Sails Sighted]].&lt;&lt;elseif $captNotGuilty is 1&gt;&gt;But you refuse to be cowed by ghosts!

As he raises his hand, you realize water is seeping into the boat from everywhere, getting higher and higher until [[you are totally submerged|Return]].&lt;&lt;else&gt;&gt;Life-in-Death wins the game. Her bloody lips contort to whistle three times and the day fades into night.
&lt;&lt;if $captGuilty is 1&gt;&gt;
Life-in-Death announces that she will spare your life, but only if you sacrifice another sailor to restore the balance you disturbed.

"No," you say. "I shot the innocent Albatross and my crew has suffered enough for it. If you let them return home, [[I surrender my life|Final Act]]."&lt;&lt;elseif $captNotGuilty is 1&gt;&gt;Life-in-Death says, "You feel no remorse for taking an innocent life. You care not for your sailors, so I will care for them instead." You try to yell out that you do care, but the [[words die in your throat|Final Act]] under her awful glare.&lt;&lt;else&gt;&gt;Life-in-Death waves her gnarled hand at the ship and you [[watch in terror|Final Act]] as your fellow sailors begin to tumble overboard.

Despite your fright, overwhelming curiosity gets the better of you. 

What else lies hidden in this magical book? You decide to:

	[[Buy the book|End]] and find another present for your friend.

&lt;&lt;elseif $captNotGuilty is 1&gt;&gt;One by one, each of your sailors drops dead, their curses and pleading eventually silenced. As the ghost ship sails away with their souls, Life-in-Death's voice whispers in your ear, "[[Do not let this lesson be in vain|Return]]."&lt;&lt;elseif $crewAngry is 1&gt;&gt;When the Captain finally dies, you realize that you and the sailors who hung the Albatross around the Captain's neck had been spared. As the ghost ship sails away with their souls, you [[make a silent vow|Return]] to Life-in-Death to never take any life for granted.&lt;&lt;elseif $crewNotAngry is 1&gt;&gt;You curse the Captain for his evil deed and yourself for condoning it. You [[die with hatred in your heart|Return]].
